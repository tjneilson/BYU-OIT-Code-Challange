# BYU-OIT-Code-Challange
Tustin Neilson's submission for the BYU OIT application coding challenge

Mark Crowther,

Attached in this repository is my submission for the code challenge you emailed me about earlier today. It is a python script designed to be run on the command line.

I spent the full 4 hours on the project. Despite this, I was not able to get the modern numerals to roman numerals portion of my code to work. I got super carried away while working on the Roman to Modern translation because I wanted my code to detect and catch user input errors (i.e. letters which are not part of the Roman numerical system, or if they input a number like IVC which isn't possible) without crashing. Then when I moved on to the second part of the problem, I made a syntax error where the recursive function translateToRome() would not recognize calls to itself, and I couldn't figure out what the problem was. Given more time I would have figured out what was wrong with my syntax and, hopefully, would have been on the right track (plus or minus some debugging and tinkering of course, hahaha). I commented out the buggy portion so it would not affect the roman to modern translation and the comments should give the general idea behind my strategy despite it's unpolished state. With more time I also would have finalized the logic for the if statement used to detect if the user inputted a modern numeral or a roman numeral, or reworked the code to simply ask the user what type of numeral (roman or modern) they plan on inputting so I wouldn't have to check the type of the input.

I hope to hear back from you again soon!
